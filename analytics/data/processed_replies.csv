1,CinematicDreamer,1 hour ago,"The ending was incredible! I had to watch it twice to catch all the subtle hints they planted throughout the movie. The parallel universe theory actually explains so many of the ""inconsistencies"" we noticed earlier in the film.",101,2025-03-25 15:53:59.848450
2,SciFiLover,45 minutes ago,"I actually predicted something similar around the halfway point, but the execution still blew me away. The visual effects team deserves an award for that final sequence!",101,2025-03-25 16:08:59.848451
3,FilmAnalyst,30 minutes ago,What I appreciated most was how they kept the scientific theories relatively grounded despite the fantastical premise. The consultation with real physicists really shows in the dialogue and plot mechanics.,101,2025-03-25 16:23:59.848452
