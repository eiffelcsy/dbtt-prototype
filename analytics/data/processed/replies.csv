The parallel universe theory actually explains so many of the ""inconsistencies"" we noticed earlier in the film.'}","{'id': 1, 'author': 'DetectiveNoir', 'date': '3 hours ago', 'content': 'The warehouse plot hole bothered me too! I think they might have cut a scene that explained it, because there was a brief mention of an informant in episode 5 that never went anywhere.'}","{'id': 1, 'author': 'MovieBuff', 'date': '12 hours ago', 'content': 'The reunion scene was perfectly executed. The way they used silence and then gradually brought in the music was masterful. I also loved how they showed the characters had grown but still retained their core personalities.'}","{'id': 1, 'author': 'HumorHound', 'date': '1 day ago', 'content': 'The impromptu competition between the two veteran comedians in episode 6 had me in stitches!
